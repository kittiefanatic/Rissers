    NEW CONTENT!! (Yayyy!)
  </div>
  <p> Welcome to where I'm REALLY making progress! I figured out how to make an input box (as shown by the password it took to get here), </br>
    so if you were given the password (If I gave it out, I probably figured out how to post stuff, so...), I trust you enough to post </br>
    without me having to set up a repository. Until I do, feel free to post whatever you like! (Within limits,... XP)</p>
    <p><input id="textBox"/></p>
    <a onclick="return typedThing();">
      Click to see if you typed the value for the success alert!
    </a>
    <p> Well...Maybe not. I need to work out how to give you the alert for this one. In the mean time, enjoy refreshing your page with that link! </p>
